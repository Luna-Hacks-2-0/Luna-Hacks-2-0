# Build a RESTful API that allows users to manage their tasks

**Objective:**

- Build an API that allows users to create, read, update and delete tasks.
- The API should be built using a popular web framework such as Express.js or Flask.
- The API should be able to handle basic CRUD operations for a task object, which should have the following properties: -
  - title(string)
  - description(string)
  - due date (date)
  - status (string: "completed" or "incomplete")
- The API should be able to handle authentication and authorization, allowing only authenticated users to access their own tasks.
- The API should be able to handle pagination and sorting of tasks.
- The API should be deployed to a public cloud platform such as Heroku or Google Cloud.
- The API should be documented using Swagger or OpenAPI

**Deliverables:**

- The source code of the API, including any necessary configuration files and scripts.
- A brief document describing how to run the API locally and how to deploy it to a public cloud platform.
- The API documentation in the form of a Swagger or OpenAPI file.
- A brief readme file that describes the API's functionality and how it was built.

**Submission:**

- Share the link of the deployed app
- Share the link of the code repository

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- The API should be functional and meet all the requirements outlined in the objective.
- The API should be well-designed, easy to understand and maintain.
- The API should be well-documented and easy to use.
- The API should be deployed and accessible to the evaluators.
- The code should be clean, well-organized and easy to read.
