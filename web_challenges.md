- It should have the same features as the previous challenge, but this time
  the ToDos should be stored in a database (NoSQL or SQL) or in a file (JSON,
  CSV, etc) or in memory (Up to you).
- Feel free to use any framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc) or no framework at all (Up to you)

**Deliverables**

- The source code of the web application.

**Submissions**

- The code should be well formatted and easy to read - use linters and
  prettifiers to format your code.
- The code should be readable and easy to understand - use meaningful variable
  names and **comments where necessary**.

## Challenge 4: Build a Github Search Web App using Javascript (Intermediate)

  framework at all (Up to you)
- Should be able to search for a GitHub user, and display the following information:
  - User Name
  - User Image
  - User Bio
  - User Location
- Should be able to search for a GitHub repo, and display the following information:
  - Repo Name
  - Stars
  - Issues
  - Description
  - No. of Contributors
- You can use any framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc)

**Deliverables**

- Share the link of the deployed app
- Share the link of the code repository

**Evaluation Criteria**

- it should have a nice UI
- At a simple glance, the user should be able to differentiate between a user and a repo
- Should have a good user experience
- Should link to User/Repo page on GitHub
- All git commits should be meaningful and detailed, and should be easy to

- The code should be readable and easy to understand - use meaningful variable
  names and **comments where necessary**.

## Challenge 5: Build a Github Search Web App using Javascript (Advanced)

**Objective:**

This is similar to the previous challenge, but this time you will need to add
tests to your code and use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your app (use Github
Actions).

- On top of the previous challenge, you will need to add tests to your code,
  that are passing - Unit Tests for now.
- You will need to use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your app (Github
  Actions recommended).
- On every push to the main branch, the CI/CD pipeline should run the tests
  and deploy the app to a hosting platform such as Netlify or Vercel.

**Deliverables**

- The source code of the web application.

**Submissions**

- Share the link of the deployed app
- Share the link of the code repository

**Evaluation Criteria**

- On top of the previous challenge evaluation criteria, your website should run
  a CI/CD Pipeline on every push to the main branch.
- All tests should pass before deploying the app.
- All tests should be meaningful and should be testing the functionality of the
  app - Behavioral Testing.
- All git commits should be meaningful and detailed, and should be easy to
  understand what was done in that commit. (For example, "Update README.md" is
  not a good commit message)
- The code should be well formatted and easy to read - use linters and
  prettifiers to format your code.
- The code should be readable and easy to understand - use meaningful variable
  names and **comments where necessary**.
