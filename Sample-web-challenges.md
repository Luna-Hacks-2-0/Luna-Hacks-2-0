**Deliverables**
- The source code of the web application.
- A brief read me that describes how the web application works.

**Submission**
- Share the link of the deployed app
- Share the link of the code repository

**Evaluation Criteria**
- The web application should be functional and should meet all the criteria in the objectives.
- The web application should have a good user interface.
- The web application should be easy to use.
- The web application should be deployed in a hosting platform such as Netlify or Vercel
- The code should be clean, well organized and easy to read.

## Challenge 2: Build a Personal Portfolio using NuxtJS and headless CMS

**Objective:**
- The NuxtJS application should be built using NuxtJS and headless CMS of your choice such as Storyblok or Strapi
- The NuxtJS application should contain the biography section displaying these properties:
