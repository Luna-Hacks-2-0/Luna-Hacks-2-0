Share the link to the Postman collection on a GitHub repository.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
The Postman collection should include all the necessary API requests.
The requests should handle errors effectively.
The requests should display weather data in a user-friendly way.
The README file should be detailed and easy to follow.

#### Creating a Simple RESTful API
**Objective:**

The code should be clean, well-organized and easy to read.

#### Creating Automated Tests
**Objective:**
Use Postman to create automated tests for the API requests created in Challenge 1.
Build a collection of tests that verify the functionality of the API requests.
The tests should include at least one test for each API request.

**Deliverables:**
A Postman collection containing the API requests and the automated tests.

**Submission:**
Share the link to the Postman collection on a GitHub repository.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
The Postman collection should include all the necessary API requests and tests.
The tests should verify the functionality of the API requests effectively.
The tests should handle errors effectively.

### 3. Expert Level Challenges

#### Build a Continuous Integration Pipeline for a REST API
**Objective:** 
Use Postman and a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or CircleCI to build a continuous integration pipeline for a REST API. Your pipeline should include linting, unit testing, integration testing, and deployment steps.
**Submission:** 
Submit your Postman collection, your pipeline configuration files, and a brief writeup explaining your pipeline strategy.

**Evaluation Criteria:** 
We will evaluate the completeness and effectiveness of your pipeline, as well as the accuracy and completeness of your tests. We will also evaluate the robustness and security of your deployment strategy.

#### Build an Automated API Test Suite with Visual Regression Testing

**Objective:** 
Use Postman and Applitools to build an automated API test suite that includes visual regression testing. Your tests should verify not only that the API endpoints return the expected data, but also that the UI components that consume that data are rendered correctly.

**Submission:** 
Submit your Postman collection, the scripts used to execute the tests, and a brief writeup explaining your testing strategy.

**Evaluation Criteria:** 
We will evaluate the completeness and accuracy of your test suite, as well as the effectiveness of your visual regression tests in catching UI-related bugs.
